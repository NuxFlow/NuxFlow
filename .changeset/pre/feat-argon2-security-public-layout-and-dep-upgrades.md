feat: Argon2id password hashing, public footer/sidebar, and major dependency upgrades

**Security — Argon2id password hashing**
- New `workers/argon2-hasher` Cloudflare Worker: imports `argon2.wasm` statically at build time, exposes `hash` and `verify` via a service binding (`ARGON2`)
- New `server/utils/pw.ts`: `nuxflowPasswordHasher` adapter that routes to the Argon2 binding in production and falls back to `node:crypto` scrypt in local dev
- Better Auth `emailAndPassword.password` and setup `complete.post.ts` now use `nuxflowPasswordHasher` instead of `better-auth/crypto`
- New `ArgonHasherBinding` type in `server/types/cloudflare-bindings.d.ts`
- New `docs/security.md` documenting algorithm parameters and the rationale for the separate Worker architecture

**Public layout — footer and sidebar**
- New `PublicSiteFooter.vue`: footer navigation driven by the `footer` menu slot, hidden when the menu has no items
- New `PublicSiteSidebar.vue`: sticky right-rail sidebar driven by the `sidebar` menu slot, hidden on mobile and when empty
- `default.vue` layout updated to a flex-column structure that accommodates both new components

**Setup improvements**
- Setup wizard no longer accepts a `domain` field — the site domain is derived from the request `Host` header, eliminating the mismatch between form input and actual hostname
- Secondary site setup (pre-created by super admin) simplified: lookup is by request host only, fallback by form domain removed
- Menu item schema: `id` and `type` made optional so newly created items that haven't been persisted yet pass validation

**Settings cleanup**
- Google Analytics measurement-ID field removed from Admin → Settings → Integrations (the `integrations.analytics_id` setting key is no longer saved or loaded)

**Dependency upgrades**
- Vitest 3 → 4: class mock factories migrated from arrow functions to `function`/`class` syntax; `poolOptions.forks.singleFork` replaced with `maxWorkers: 1`
- Zod 3 → 4: `z.record()` calls updated to two-arg form `z.record(z.string(), ...)` across all server routes; `schema._type` references replaced with `z.infer<typeof schema>`
- `@nuxtjs/i18n` 9 → 10: removed `restructureDir: false` (type changed to string-only) and `lazy: true` (now default); `langDir` set to absolute path
- `ai` 6 → 7, `@ai-sdk/openai/anthropic/google` 3 → 4, `openai` 4 → 6: no API changes required
- `ulid` 2 → 3: drop-in replacement, no changes required
- `stripe` 17 → 22: `customer.subscription.*` webhook type assertion updated to `as unknown as` for fields removed from SDK types
- `@nuxt/test-utils` 3 → 4: no changes required

**TypeScript / test compatibility fixes (surfaced by upgrades)**
- `db.values<[string]>()` generic corrected (was `<[string][]>`, which returned the wrong nested type)
- Non-null assertions added to `allSites[0]` accesses in multi-site middleware (`noUncheckedIndexedAccess`)
- `H3Event` type assertions updated to use `as unknown as` intermediate where needed
- `tests/helpers/globals.ts` annotated `@ts-nocheck` for globalThis property augmentation
- `seedTier` seed helper: removed `slug` field not present in `membershipTiers` schema
- `pages-access.test.ts`: `settings` values passed as objects, not `JSON.stringify` strings
- Video token handler checks `response.ok` before calling `response.json()` to avoid TypeError on error bodies
